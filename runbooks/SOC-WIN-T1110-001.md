# SOC-WIN-T1110-001 – Brute Force (Windows)

## What this alert means
This alert fires when multiple failed logon attempts are detected from the same source IP
within a short time window. This may indicate:
- password spraying
- brute force attack
- misconfigured service account
- user typing wrong password repeatedly

---

## Severity
High (credential access attempt)

---

## Initial triage questions
1. Is the source IP internal or external?
2. Is the target user a privileged account?
3. Do we see a successful logon after the failures?
4. Has this source IP attempted other accounts?
5. Is this a known scanner or monitoring system?

---

## Analyst pivots
Check:
- other failed logons from same IP
- successful logons after failures
- logon attempts against multiple users
- activity from this IP on other hosts
- geolocation of source IP

---

## False positive considerations
Common false positives:
- misconfigured scheduled tasks
- password expired on service account
- user forgot password
- vulnerability scanner

---

## Escalation criteria
Escalate if:
- successful logon follows failures
- multiple users targeted
- privileged account targeted
- source IP is external and unknown

---

## Recommended response
- Temporarily block source IP
- Force password reset for affected user
- Review successful logons
- Notify IAM or IR team if escalation criteria met
